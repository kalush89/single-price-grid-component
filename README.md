## My process

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

Wish to focus on the following concepts in the future
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/8.0.1/normalize.css) - This helped me for fix an issue with the button element in Firefox. I will use this resourse going forward.
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Helped alot. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
